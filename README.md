**I'm a Full-stack Developer.**
_Building digital products, brands, and experience._

I am a Web and App Developer, & I love to work on products that create significant constructive change in a day to day lives of people. With over 3+ years of experience, I have worked with many companies and their products. One of my interests is learning, I always love to learn new technologies and keep improving my skills.

Other than coding I love Travelling, Fitness & helping others in the community. I am also a strong believer in Financial Independence & I have already started working on products that will make that happen.
